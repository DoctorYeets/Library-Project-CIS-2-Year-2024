This is a group project for the CIS 76 class in the Fall semester of 2024 at Evergreen Community College. 
We are working together to implement a Library managment system by filling in the TODO secions of code in the: 
  -Library.java
  -Book.java
The other files are for testing of the code by running Driver.java.
